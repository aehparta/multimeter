# Compile

## Prerequisites

- Qt 5.11 with following modules
  - core
  - qml
  - quick
  - widgets
  - bluetooth

### Linux

Easy install using `apt-get` (works at least in Ubuntu 19.04 and Rasbian Buster):
```sh
apt-get install qt5-default qtdeclarative5-dev qtconnectivity5-dev
```

### Windows and macOS

Unfortunately I have no access to either of these since switching fully to Linux.

But as Qt is cross-platform framework, there should be no problem compiling the app to either of these platforms as long as Qt 5.11 and all the required modules are installed.
